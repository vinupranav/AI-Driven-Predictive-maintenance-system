# Project Description: ML-Based Vehicle Predictive Maintenance System with Real-Time Visualization
## Overview

The ML-Based Vehicle Predictive Maintenance System is an AI-driven solution designed to forecast vehicle maintenance needs by leveraging machine learning techniques and real-time sensor data. The system preprocesses incoming sensor data to ensure accuracy, applies a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model for maintenance predictions, and integrates a user-friendly web application for real-time data visualization. This system is built to enhance fleet management by predicting maintenance requirements, estimating potential maintenance dates, and providing probability assessments for component failures, thereby reducing costs and ensuring efficient operations.

## Features
Real-Time Sensor Data Collection: Continuously gathers sensor data from vehicles to monitor performance metrics and detect potential issues.
Reliable Data Preprocessing: Preprocesses sensor data to remove noise and anomalies, ensuring high-quality inputs for the prediction model.
Predictive Maintenance Using GBM: Utilizes a Gradient Boosting Machine model to forecast maintenance needs, identifying when and where potential issues may arise.
Web Application Integration: Deploys a Streamlit-based web interface for real-time visualization of sensor data and predictive analytics, making insights accessible and actionable.
Maintenance Probability Prediction: Provides real-time predictions of maintenance needs based on model outputs, enabling proactive decision-making.
Advance Maintenance Date Estimation: Estimates maintenance dates 2-3 weeks in advance, allowing for timely scheduling and minimizing unexpected downtime.
Failure Probability Assessment: Calculates the likelihood of specific part failures, offering detailed insights for preventive maintenance strategies.
Improved Predictive Accuracy: Enhances the precision of maintenance predictions, allowing for better resource allocation and reduced emergency repairs.
Proactive Maintenance Scheduling: Facilitates the timely scheduling of maintenance activities, thereby minimizing vehicle downtime and ensuring operational efficiency.
